=======================
WOM Step 8 — PUSH / PULL Buffer Stock Switching

Overview
--------
PULL (default): demand-driven. psi4supply[P] at leaf_in is set by backward
demand propagation. Production = what demand needs.

PUSH: supply-driven. psi4supply[P] at leaf_in is set by a PUSH production
schedule (fixed weekly qty or buffer-replenishment formula), independent of
downstream demand. The entire InBound sub-chain below the decoupling node
acts as a pass-through pipeline — each node ships ALL available supply upward
so that the decoupling node (MOM) accumulates buffer inventory.

plan_mode values
----------------
"pull"     : default, demand-driven (OutBound + PULL InBound nodes)
"push"     : decoupling node (MOM) — receives push supply, ships to demand,
             holds buffer inventory
"push_sub" : InBound nodes BELOW the decoupling node — ship ALL available
             supply upward (no demand-side gate)

Execution order (per planning cycle)
-------------------------------------
    Step 4  BackwardPlanner.run()          fills psi4demand (demand truth)
    Step 5  copy_demand_to_supply()        psi4supply <- copy of psi4demand
    Step 8  PushProductionPlanner.setup()  overwrite leaf_in P + mark modes
    Step 6  ForwardPlanner.run()           propagates from leaf_in forward

PushProductionPlanner.setup() MUST run between Step 5 and Step 6.

PUSH production modes
---------------------
Mode 1 - Fixed quantity  (push_qty_per_week > 0):
    leaf_in.psi4supply[w][P] = push_qty_per_week lots for every week w.

Mode 2 - Replenishment-to-buffer  (push_qty_per_week == 0, no LT):
    Simulate rolling inventory at MOM:
        I[0]    = buffer_lots  (start at full buffer)
        push[w] = max(buffer_lots - I_prev + demand_w, 0)
        I[w]    = max(I_prev + push[w] - demand_w, 0)

Mode 3 - Time-phased (pre_build_qty_per_week > 0 AND pre_build_end_week set):
    Phase 1 (w <= pre_build_end_week): fixed pre_build_qty_per_week
        -> buffer accumulates intentionally (差分が積み上がる: pre-build intent)
    Phase 2 (w > pre_build_end_week): classic order-up-to replenishment
        from decoupling node itself (staircase signal, no further accumulation)

Mode 4 - LT-shifted demand  (push_lead_time_weeks > 0):
    push[w] = demand_ref_node.psi4demand[w + LT][S]
    When w + LT >= n_weeks: produce 0 (natural EOL stop).

    This single parameter captures the full DBR buffer lifecycle:
      - Pre-build : weeks where demand[w+LT] > 0 but demand[w] = 0
                    -> production starts LT weeks before demand arrives
      - Steady    : production = staircase = consumption (buffer flat)
      - Staircase : production steps DOWN LT weeks BEFORE consumption steps
                    -> buffer absorbs the LT-week gap at each step
      - EOL stop  : demand[w+LT] = 0 -> production = 0, LT weeks before
                    last demand week -> buffer depletes to 0 at lifecycle end

    IMPORTANT (2028-07-13, per user correction on WOM's core Lot_ID
    principle): Lot_IDs are minted exactly ONCE, up front, at initial
    planning (assign_demand_lots_from_dict) -- never fabricated mid-plan.
    Mode 4's leaf-in assignment therefore does NOT mint new Lot_IDs; it
    re-times the EXISTING Lot_IDs already sitting at
    demand_ref_node.psi4demand[w+LT][S] (see setup(), the
    is_lt_shifted_mode() branch). Modes 1-3 remain anonymous PUSH-to-stock
    schedules (no single future demand event to anchor to) and still mint
    fresh Lot_IDs via LotIDGenerator -- see the KNOWN LIMITATION note in
    setup() for the downstream-matching caveat this implies for those modes.

Region-proportional lot assignment
------------------------------------
PUSH lots must carry region tags to route correctly through SP -> DAD in
ForwardPlanner._propagate_to_child. Distribution uses TOTAL regional demand
ratio (sum across all weeks) so every production week is tagged correctly.
(Modes 1-3 only -- Mode 4 lots already carry their original region tag,
inherited from the reused Lot_ID.)
