=====================
Data classes for PPC (Profit / Price / Cost) Simulation Engine.

Design:
    - PPCEvent: single financial event on the supply chain (immutable record)
    - PPCTrustEvent: reconciliation alert for a lot
    - LotCostAccumulator: mutable per-lot cost state during computation
    - PPCSimulationResult: final output bundle

PPC Event types:
    Forward:
        supplier_cost          - material purchase at Supplier node
        conversion_cost        - production cost at MOM node
        transfer_price_set     - transfer price determined at MOM (informational)
        logistics_cost         - freight cost on an edge
        insurance_cost         - insurance on an edge
        tariff_cost            - import duty on cross-border edge
        landed_cost_total      - sum of transfer + logistics + insurance + tariff (informational)
        warehouse_cost         - storage cost at DAD/Operation node
        sga_cost               - selling/general/admin cost at a node
        marketing_cost         - marketing cost at a node
        hq_royalty             - global HQ brand royalty (future)
    Revenue:
        market_revenue         - sale revenue at leaf_out (market channel)
    Backward:
        backward_allowable     - allowable cost computed backward from market price

cost_phase values (Phase 3: FOB/CIF/DAD breakdown):
    EXW    : ex-works supplier cost (raw material purchase)
    FOB    : factory-to-origin-port logistics (Supplier->MOM edge)
    MOM    : manufacturing conversion cost at MOM node
    CIF    : ocean freight + insurance + bonded-warehouse handling at first DAD
    TARIFF : import duty (inbound or outbound)
    DAD    : domestic distribution (inter-DAD edges + subsequent DAD node costs)
    SGA    : selling/general/admin cost at any node
    REVENUE: market revenue event
    ""     : informational / reconciliation events (landed_cost_total, backward_allowable, etc.)

Trust Event types (reconciliation):
    NEGATIVE_MARGIN                - forward cost > backward allowable at leaf_out
    TARIFF_SHOCK                   - tariff cost > 20% of transfer price
    LANDED_COST_EXCEEDS_MARKET     - landed cost at DAD > market price
    MOM_PROFIT_TOO_LOW             - MOM gross profit < 0
    CHANNEL_MARGIN_TOO_LOW         - channel gross margin < 5%
    HQ_ROYALTY_BURDEN_TOO_HIGH     - royalty > 10% of market price

class PPCEvent:
    """
    A single financial event in the PPC Simulation Engine.

    All amounts are in both local currency and base currency (JPY by default).

    IMPORTANT convention (added when the qty-aggregation bug was fixed):
    amount_local / amount_base / amount_per_unit_base are all PER-UNIT
    amounts (the master-rate value for one physical unit, converted to base
    currency). qty carries the real physical quantity represented by the
    underlying aggregated weekly PSI record (one accumulator/event set can
    represent many units — see ppc_psi_bridge.psi_to_sales_records). Do NOT
    multiply amount_base by qty when reasoning about a single event's cost
    propagation (tariff %, margin checks, backward_allowable, etc. all
    correctly operate on a per-unit basis). Only multiply by qty when
    producing an absolute-currency TOTAL for reporting — this is done
    centrally in ppc_kpi.py's build_* functions, which is the single place
    responsible for converting per-unit amounts into real totals.
